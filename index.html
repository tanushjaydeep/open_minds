<h3>Pre-School</h3>

<p>Children are enrolled into different programmes according to their age <br>
    : Pre - Nursery, Nursery, Kindergarten 1, Kindergarten 2

    The thematic <br>
    curriculum for preschool draws on neuroscientific research on how the <br>
    brain learns naturally and what learning experiences are relevant at a particular age and stage in life.</p>

<h3>Middle-School</h3>

<p>At Open Minds, we emphasize on providing an inspiring school environment which <br>
    enables a shift from rote methods to a course beyond textbooks.The curriculum aims<br>
    to provide experiences and opportunities for students to think differently, analyze and<br>
 evaluate independently and foster a place where we can soften subject boundaries...</p>

<h3>High-School</h3>

<p>The Primary and Middle school approach of using experiential and student centric <br>
    methodologies continues in the Open Minds High School years. The transition is <br>
    smooth and allows the students to prepare for the school leaving certificate examinations.<br>
